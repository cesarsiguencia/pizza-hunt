# Pizza Hunt by CS

My first NoSQL application that allows users to interact by adding their unique favorite pizzas and adding comments to the pizzas to create a discussion among users. 

Users are able to
- View all pizzas in the database and its comments
- Add a pizza to the database, including the pizza size and select from a variety of topping or adding your own
- Create a discussion by adding your name and comment to the pizza.
- Reply to comments created by users

### Technologies Used

### Installation
1. Git clone of download the application and load on VSCode.
2. Run 'npm start' and load on localhost:3301
3. The application should not have any data. Begin adding pizzas at your will!
